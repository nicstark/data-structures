# Weekly Assignment 9
In this assignment we set up our Particle Photon boards to push the sensor data to a PostgreSQL database 
#### We did this by:

* Creating a new table for the data in Amazon AWS
* Accessing the Particle data through a request to a constructed URL
* Storing that data in a variable
* Inserting the values from that variable into the AWS database
 
#### We utilized:

* Amazon AWS API
* Particle Photon
