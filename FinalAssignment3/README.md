# Final Assignment 3
In this assignment we used sensor data from a Particle Photon to generate a visualization
#### We did this by:

* Programming our particle photon to push light sensor data to the internet every 30 seconds
* Setting up a script to get that data from Particle and insert it into an AWS PostgreSQL database
* Retrieving the data from the database
* Writing a D3.js page to use the data to visualize when the light sensor detected light
 
#### We utilized:

* Amazon AWS
* Particle Photon
* Node.js
* Express
* D3.js
