# Weekly Assignment 3
In this assignment we used an API to geo-locate the addresses from the AA data
#### We did this by:

* Reading in the JSON file with the data we created last week
* Setting up the Texas Geolocate API
* Passing the API each address
* Running the loop with ASYNC to keep the data from getting mixed up
 
 
#### We utilized:

* Texas A&M Geocoder API
* ASYNC
